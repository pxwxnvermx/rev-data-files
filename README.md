# Binary Visualizer
This idea was built after taking inspiration from a Tsoding stream on Data Reverse Engineering.

I have tried to keep the dependency on external libraries as low as possible. This can be done in a lot less code (or more) by using numpy and matplotlib, but for purposes of learning and understanding how this works, i felt it would be better to reinvent the wheel.
